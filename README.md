Mod for DEUS EX GOTY - removes ammo carry limits

Smashing crates and picking up supplies is, in a manner of speaking, the only reward you get in the fabulous "Deus Ex GOTY" for all the hard and dangerous work you do while trying to save the world from a dark power which attempts to take hold of it. Having to leave many of these goodies behind just because you've already reached your carry limit is an extremely frustrating experience, especially when considering that you will most likely be in dire need of the exact same supplies some ten minutes later on. 

For me, this is the biggest and, in terms of gameplay, the only annoyance in this great classic gem. Hence I created this mod which simply lets you pick up all the ammo you come across. While at it, I also removed the austere limits for lockpicks, medkits, biocells and multitools.

Since nothing in this game is really abundant, you may not even notice the changes.

I did this entirely for my own private use, but I kept coming across postings in forums and on portals which seem to indicate a certain demand. So be my guest ;)


# Installation

You will need an unmodded vanilla GOTY version of the game (v1.112fm).

Go to the ..\System subfolder of your Deus Ex installation, rename the file "DeusEx.u" to "DeusEx.u.old" and copy over the "DeusEx.u" downloaded from here. 

That's all there is to it.

To uninstall, delete the above "DeusEx.u" file and rename its backup copy back to "DeusEx.u".
