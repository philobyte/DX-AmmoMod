Mod for ***Deus Ex GOTY*** - removes ammo carry limits

Smashing crates and picking up supplies is, in a manner of speaking, the only reward you get in the fabulous **"Deus Ex GOTY"** for all the hard and dangerous work you do while trying to save the world from the grips of a sinister power. Having to leave many of these goodies behind just because you've already reached your carry limit is an extremely frustrating experience, especially when considering that you will most likely be in dire need of the exact same supplies some ten or fifteen minutes later on. 

For me, this is the biggest and, in terms of gameplay, the only annoyance in this great classic gem. Hence I created this mod which simply lets you pick up all the ammo you come across. While at it, I also removed the austere limits for lockpicks, medkits, biocells and multitools.

Since nothing in this game is really abundant, you may not even notice the changes.

I made these modifications entirely for my own private use, but I kept coming across postings in forums and on portals which seem to indicate a certain demand. So be my guest ;)


## Installation

You will need an unmodded vanilla GOTY version of the game (**v1.112fm**).

- Download the **"DeusEx.u"** file from the *System* folder in the above repository, or use [this direct link](https://github.com/philobyte/DX-AmmoMod/raw/master/System/DeusEx.u).

- Go to the *..\System* subfolder of your Deus Ex installation and rename the file "DeusEx.u" to "DeusEx.u.old".

- Then copy over the "DeusEx.u" file downloaded from here. 


To uninstall, delete the "DeusEx.u" file and rename its backup copy back to "DeusEx.u".
